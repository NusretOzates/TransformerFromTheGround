# TransformerFromTheGround
Transformer Model implementation from the ground using keras and core tensorflow

I get the codes from https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/text/transformer.ipynb and learn how to build a transformer model from the ground
the problem with this notebook is, it is hard to save and reuse. Also, with my redesign you can use model.fit() function to train your model.

This is not a professional implementation and made for fun and study purposes! You are welcome to suggest all kind of improvements:)
